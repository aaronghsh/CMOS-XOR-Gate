## Project Objective

Design and test a **CMOS XOR logic gate** using discrete MOSFETs, ensuring:
- Functional logic operation (truth table verification).
- Clean HIGH/LOW transitions with minimal noise.
- Acceptable **rise/fall times** and **propagation delay**.
- Real-world validation using **Analog Discovery 3 (AD3)**.

## Features

- **CMOS-Based XOR Logic**:
  - Built using 6 NMOS and 6 PMOS transistors from two CD4007B ICs.
  - Mimics ideal transistor sizing with an approximate 5:2 PMOS:NMOS ratio.
- **Truth Table Verification**:
  - Inputs (A, B) tested through all combinations: 00, 01, 10, 11.
  - Output matched standard XOR behavior.
- **Static Testing**:
  - Input A held constant while input B varied as a square wave.
  - Voltage swing measured from â‰ˆ5V to â‰ˆ30mV, confirming sharp logic levels.
